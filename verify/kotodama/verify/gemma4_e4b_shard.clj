(ns kotodama.verify.gemma4-e4b-shard
  "Rank-scoped verification of the REAL gemma4:e4b GGUF along a murakumo-plan
  layer range: the node holding `--layers lo:hi` opens the local artifact and
  proves it can serve its shard — every owned tensor present, the contract
  tensors inside the range byte-identical (span + payload prefix), and the
  shard's resident byte total reported for the credits ledger.

  Runs under the JVM (clojure -M:verify-shard) AND babashka (bb -cp …) so a
  fleet node needs nothing but the bb binary and this repo's sources — the
  distributed half of kotoba-native inference, before the compute lands.

  usage: --layers 0:21 --first | --layers 21:42 --last [--model gemma4:e4b]"
