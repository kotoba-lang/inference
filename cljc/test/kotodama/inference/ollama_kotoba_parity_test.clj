;; The Kotoba decision cores of the Ollama-compatible surface, checked three
;; ways (ADR-2608138800):
;;
;;   1. authority  — the shipped resources/kotodama/oracle/*.kir.edn is what
;;                   kotoba/*_core.kotoba compiles to right now. Without this a
;;                   stale artifact keeps serving while the source reads
;;                   correct, and nothing says so.
;;   2. semantics  — each export against the Ollama wire contract, written out
;;                   as literals. The oracle here is the protocol, not a second
;;                   Clojure implementation of it; a mirror implementation
;;                   would just be the thing this migration removes.
;;   3. admission  — every DECISION core stays inside the native word-typed
;;                   boundary, so "qualifies on the native backend" is measured
;;                   rather than asserted in a comment. kernel_math_core is
;;                   float-typed and deliberately outside it (ADR-2608139000);
;;                   kernel_math_parity_test owns that split and asserts both
;;                   sides of it.
;;
;; Requires the compiler, which is :test-only. Production never compiles.
