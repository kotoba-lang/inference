;; The Kotoba engine kernel against the cljc implementation it has to match.
;;
;; Unlike the ollama decision cores, this one has a REAL oracle: the same
;; quantities are already computed by kotodama.inference.ops, which is what
;; the running model uses. So parity here is not "does it match a literal I
;; wrote down" but "does the Kotoba kernel agree with the engine".
;;
;; Float equality is exact where the operation order is identical (a left fold
;; in both), and within a tolerance where it is not.
