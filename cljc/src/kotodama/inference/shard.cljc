(ns kotodama.inference.shard
  "Layer-sharded execution contracts for kotoba-native distributed inference.

  This is the missing seam between murakumo.infer.plan (memory-weighted
  contiguous layer ranges over a fleet) and the kotodama.inference runtime
  (torch-clj graphs computed by num-clj backends): given a plan-shaped
  assignment list, decide WHICH GGUF tensors each rank owns, and prove that
  running the decoder stack rank-by-rank — with the activation crossing an
  EDN handoff between ranks — is byte-for-byte the same computation as the
  unsharded forward.

  Everything here is pure cljc: it runs in the JVM verifier, in babashka on a
  fleet node, in a browser WebGPU host, and inside a kotoba WASM component.
  File IO and transport stay host-injected, as everywhere else in kotodama."
