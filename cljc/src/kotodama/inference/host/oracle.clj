(ns kotodama.inference.host.oracle
  "Execute the precompiled Kotoba decision cores that this repo ships.

  Dual-source authority (ADR-2608130700):

    1. authority : kotoba/*_core.kotoba              (the source of truth)
    2. artifact  : resources/kotodama/oracle/*.kir.edn (compiled, shipped)
    3. host      : delegates here instead of restating the rule in Clojure

  The compiler is a TEST-time dependency. Production loads KIR and interprets
  it, so a running server never carries the compiler, and the artifact it runs
  is byte-identical to the one the parity test compiled.

  Fail-closed: a missing or unreadable artifact throws. There is deliberately
  no Clojure fallback — a fallback would let the server keep answering with a
  second, unreviewed copy of the policy, which is the failure this arrangement
  exists to prevent (CLAUDE.md: a check that could not run must not return the
  value of a check that passed).

  This is not `murakumo.kotoba.oracle`. That one is `.cljc`, carries a
  35-artifact catalog, and has a ClojureScript resource-loader injection point.
  This is the JVM-only three-artifact case; copying 337 lines to get 40 would
  create the vendored copy `verify-vendored-copies` exists to find."
