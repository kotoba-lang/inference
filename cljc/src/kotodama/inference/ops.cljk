;; These are ADDITIVE: they exist alongside the golden-verified ops above and
;; are the ones the Gemma4/PLE forward pass composes. The differences from the
;; original ops are all confirmed against the real GGUF tensors + Hugging Face
;; `modeling_gemma4.py` (see host/jvm.clj docstring for the tensor evidence):
;;
;;   * Gemma4RMSNorm multiplies by `weight` directly (NOT `1 + weight`) because
;;     the GGUF stores full-scale norm weights (attn_norm ~= 8, q_norm ~= 0.98),
;;     not the "delta from 1" Gemma2/3 convention `gemma-rmsnorm-values` assumes.
;;   * value states are RMS-normalized with a *weightless* norm (v_norm,
;;     `with_scale=False`) — there is no GGUF tensor for it.
;;   * attention softmax scale is 1.0 (Gemma4 `self.scaling = 1.0`); the QK
;;     magnitude is controlled by the learned q_norm / k_norm weights, not a
;;     `1/sqrt(head_dim)` divide.
;;   * RoPE is rotate-half / NEOX (pairs `(i, i+dim/2)`), not the GPT-J
;;     interleaved pairing `rope-interleaved-values` implements.
;;   * the gated MLP and the per-layer-input gate use `gelu_pytorch_tanh`, not
;;     SiLU.
