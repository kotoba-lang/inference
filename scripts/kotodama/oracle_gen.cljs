(ns kotodama.oracle-gen
  "JVM-free regeneration of the precompiled KIR oracle artifacts.

  This is the Kotoba CLI build path for the product build this repo ships:
  kotoba/*_core.kotoba → resources/kotodama/oracle/*.kir.edn, the artifacts a
  running server executes through kotodama.inference.host.oracle (ADR-2608130700
  dual-source authority). The compiler is kotoba-lang/amu pinned by nbb.edn to
  the SAME :git/sha the :test alias in deps.edn carries — one source of truth
  for what the language admits — running under nbb (Node), so no JVM process
  participates in the compile.

  The pipeline mirrors kotoba.compiler.core/compile-source's :wasm32-kotoba-v1
  branch up to the KIR: sema/analyze → admission/check (the same fail-closed
  capability gate) → ir/lower. The shipped artifact is the KIR document the
  branch returns in :kir, pretty-printed. Two printing realities must be
  bridged for the output to be byte-identical with the JVM oracle (both
  verified 2026-09-01, all seven cores):

    1. cljs.pprint renders a JS BigInt as #object[BigInt 1]; the JVM prints
       the same value as a bare integer. Every BigInt leaf is walked to a
       symbol whose name is its decimal digits — pprint lays a bare symbol
       out exactly like the bare integer.
    2. nbb's pprint port emits a trailing space on some closer lines and a
       doubled final newline; both are normalised away.

  Commands:

    nbb scripts/kotodama/oracle_gen.cljs            # parity gate (default):
                                                    #   compile every core,
                                                    #   compare with the shipped
                                                    #   artifact, exit 1 on drift
    nbb scripts/kotodama/oracle_gen.cljs --write    # regenerate the shipped
                                                    #   artifacts in place

  Rollback / oracle retention: the JVM route is UNCHANGED and remains the
  authority —

    clojure -M:test:gen    # JVM regeneration (the pre-existing command)
    clojure -M:test        # JVM parity gate over the same fixtures

  One documented rollback command: delete scripts/kotodama/oracle_gen.cljs and
  nbb.edn (`git rm nbb.edn scripts/kotodama/oracle_gen.cljs`). Nothing else in
  the repository depends on either file."
